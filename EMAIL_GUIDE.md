## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Email Security:
- **Use App Passwords**: Never use regular email passwords
- **Dedicated Account**: Use separate email account for the system
- **Access Control**: Only admins can configure email settings
- **Data Protection**: Emails contain only attendance data, no sensitive information

### Privacy:
- Students control their own email addresses
- Email addresses are optional
- Only the student can send their own attendance
- No sharing of email addresses between users

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Email Issues:

#### 1. **Email Not Sending**
- Check internet connection
- Verify email configuration in Admin Panel
- Ensure app password is correct (not regular password)
- Check SMTP server and port settings

#### 2. **Authentication Failed**
- Verify app password is generated correctly
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- Check email address is typed correctly
- Try regenerating app password

#### 3. **Email Not Received**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify recipient email address
- Try sending test email first
- Check email provider's delivery restrictions

#### 4. **SMTP Errors**
- Verify SMTP server address
- Check port number (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
- Ensure firewall allows SMTP connections
- Try different email provider if issues persist

### Error Messages:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Email not configured" | Admin needs to set up email in Admin Panel |
| "Authentication failed" | Check app password and email settings |
| "SMTP connection failed" | Verify internet and SMTP settings |
| "Invalid email address" | Check email format (must contain @ and .) |
