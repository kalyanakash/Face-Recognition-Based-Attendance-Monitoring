## üîß Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- **Camera not working**: Check if another app is using the camera
- **Permission denied**: Allow camera access in browser/system settings
- **Wrong camera**: Modify `config.py` and change `CAMERA_INDEX`

### Recognition Issues
- **Face not detected**: Ensure good lighting and face the camera directly
- **Wrong person recognized**: Retrain the model with more training images
- **Unknown person**: Make sure the person is registered and model is trained

### Login Issues
- **Admin password wrong**: Check `TrainingImageLabel/psd.txt` file
- **Student ID not found**: Verify the ID exists in student records
- **Can't access panels**: Clear browser cache and restart application

### Performance Issues
- **Slow recognition**: Adjust confidence threshold in `config.py`
- **App running slowly**: Close other applications using camera/CPU
- **Training takes long**: This is normal for large numbers of students

## üìã Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Regular Backups**: Backup the entire project folder regularly
2. **Password Security**: Use strong passwords and change them regularly
3. **Model Retraining**: Retrain the model when adding many new students
4. **Monitor Accuracy**: Check recognition accuracy and retrain if needed

### For Students
1. **Good Lighting**: Take attendance in well-lit areas
2. **Face the Camera**: Look directly at the camera for best results
3. **Remove Obstructions**: Remove glasses, masks, or hats if recognition fails
4. **One Person**: Ensure only one person is in the camera frame

### Data Management
1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old attendance files periodically
